I'm Johannes Wahle, a senior software developer at [sevdesk](https://www.sevdesk.de) with a background in mathematics.
My main focus is backend development in Kotlin, but I have also occasionally worked on TypeScript/React, PHP and Python projects.  
I used to be a contributor to the [CamillaDSP](https://github.com/HEnquist/camilladsp) audio project
([GUI](https://github.com/HEnquist/camillagui), [Backend](https://github.com/HEnquist/camillagui-backend)),
and I am maintaining a [shell script](https://github.com/JWahle/piCoreCDSP) to easily install it on [piCorePlayer](https://www.picoreplayer.org/).

In my free time, I like to occupy myself with various self-improvement and educational topics.
Until 2012 I used to play table soccer very competitively,
and I am still the captain of the [Hannover 96 table soccer team](https://www.instagram.com/hannover96tischfussball/).
With one European Championship and twelve German Championships, we are the most successful German table soccer team to date.
